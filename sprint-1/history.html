                    <h2>Ornithopter</h2>
                    <p>Ornithopter, machine designed to fly by the flapping of its wings in imitation of birds. The wooden bird said to have been made about 400 bc by Archytas of Tarentum is one of the earliest examples. The Greek myth of Daedalus and Icarus involves man’s use of wings in the manner of birds. Leonardo da Vinci made many drawings and models of such aircraft in the late 15th century. Although a few short flights have been recorded, ornithopters remain impractical.</p>

                     <h2>Hot air balloon</h2>
                     <p>A hot air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft consisting of a bag, called an envelope, which contains heated air. Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid propane. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope.</p>

                     <p>In aviation, a multiplane is a fixed-wing aircraft-configuration featuring multiple wing planes. The wing planes may be stacked one above another, or one behind another, or both in combination. Types having a small number of planes have specific names and are not usually described as multiplanes:</p>
                     <ul>
                       <li>  Biplane - two wings stacked one above the other</li>
                     <li> Triplane - three wings stacked one above another </li>
                     <li> Quadruplane- four stacked wings </li>
                     <li>    Tandem wing - two main planes, one behind the other. The tandem triple or tandem triplet configuration has three lifting surfaces one behind another.</li>
